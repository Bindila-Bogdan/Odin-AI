### Fully automated machine learning system that solves any classification or regression problem that is stored in a tabular format

This represents the backend of Odin AI, a web platform that optimizes products and business processes by automatically generating in a few minutes, artificial intelligence-based solutions that solve data prediction problems stored in tabular format. Django was used as the web framework for embedding the tool and creating the API. The application was hosted on Azure by using the App Service.

## Features

- Advanced data cleaning and complete feature engineering
- Search for optimally preprocessed data instances for each model
- Training of various models
- Bayesian optimization
- Stacking ensemble
- Easy-to-reuse models
- Reports that explain the created solution
- Operable without programming knowledge
