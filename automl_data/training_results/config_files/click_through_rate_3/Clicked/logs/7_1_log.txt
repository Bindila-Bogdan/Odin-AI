9. Scaling features
	9.a. Scaling continuous features
		Scaler type is StandardScaler
	9.b. Scaling categorical features
		Number of scalable columns: 1
		Scale entire categorical dataframe: True
		Scaler type is StandardScaler
	7.f. Feature selection
		Discarded features are: ['City_long_text_new', 'City_long_text_north', 'City_long_text_west', 'Country_long_text_islands']
	7.g. Feature construction
		(Daily internet usage Timestamp_day_cos *) => new_feat_0
		(Age City_chars_no /rev) => new_feat_1
		(Age Timestamp_day_cos /rev) => new_feat_2
